# CsFinalProject

We can use this utility to study the arrival and departure patterns of airplanes at the airport. By assessing these trends, you can identify peak hours, busy days, and system delays. Moreover, this utility can be used to evaluate the airport's capacity and the capability to manage arriving and leaving planes. This can help determine whether the current infrastructure is suitable or if it requires any modifications. Furthermore, simulations allow you to test various changes without directly implementing them. For example, you can evaluate the impact of introducing new routes to determine their effectiveness before implementing them in real-life to prevent any problems. Furthermore, a realistic environment is provided to train airport staff and improve their skills to make decisions and react to different scenarios.
